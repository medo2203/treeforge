> Transform text structures into real folders and files with a single click

TreeForge is a VS Code extension that creates folder and file structures from text representations. It's perfect for quickly scaffolding projects, recreating structures from documentation, or setting up test environments.

## Features

- **Text to Structure**: Convert text representations of folder structures into actual folders and files
- **Multiple Formats**: Support for indentation-based formats and tree visualization characters (â”£, â”ƒ, â”—, etc.)
- **Structure Preview**: Preview the structure before creating it
- **Simple Interface**: Right-click and select from the context menu to create or preview
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detect files vs folders

## Usage

1. **Input Your Structure**:

   - Enter or paste a text representation of your desired folder structure
   - Select the text (optional - if not selected, the entire document will be used)

2. **Create Structure**:

   - Right-click and select "TreeForge: Create Folder Structure"
   - Or use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "TreeForge"
   - Preview the structure and confirm
   - Select a target location
   - Done! Your folders and files are created

3. **Preview Only**:
   - Right-click and select "TreeForge: Preview Structure"
   - See what will be created without actually creating anything
